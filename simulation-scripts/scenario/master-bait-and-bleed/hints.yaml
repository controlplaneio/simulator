  hints:
    hint-1: "Task 1: Have a look at your environment variables with ```printenv```. Does anything look suspicious?"
    hint-2: "Task 1: Looks like you may be able to access the Kubernetes API on port 8080. Try curling some of the end-points. You may need to download curl."
    hint-3: "Task 2: The API appears to be open on the Master node without certification. Have a look at the API configuration and see why that is."
    hint-4: "Task 2: --insecure-bind-address and --insecure-port is enabled on the API in the manifest at /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml. Set the insecure port to 0 and delete the binding."
