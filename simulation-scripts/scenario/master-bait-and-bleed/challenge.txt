An ubuntu pod in your cluster can reportedly make API calls beyond what the default service account should be able to do.
Your cluster is running with master IP: $MASTER_IP_ADDRESSES

Starting Point: ubuntu pod in the master-bait-and-bleed namespace.

Difficulty :

Task 1: Figure out how this is possible by making an API call from the cluster.
Task 2: Amend the configuration so nothing can access the API beyond their intended RBAC capabilities.
