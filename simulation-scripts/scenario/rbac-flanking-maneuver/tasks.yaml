    hints:
      - text: >-
          Find open SSH port in workload. You can use nmap. Remember it runs on
          a NodePort.
      - text: The open NodePort was 30022. Brute force host SSH default password.
      - text: Username is admin and password is password.
      - text: Look around for credentials and tools. Can you hit the API?
      - text: >-
          Use wget to hit the API at default port 6443. The service account
          token looks like it can schedule workloads and get secrets.

    hints:
      - text: What identity is assigned the pod?
      - text: Have a look at the roles and rolebindings.
      - text: >-
          Since the pod doesn't need to talk to the API, you can just delete the
          rolebinding.
