Scenario: You have been asked to perform a security test on an application hosted in Kubernetes.
To make the test as close to reality as possible you have only been told that the application is exposed as a NodePort service on IP address x.x.x.x.
The application is the only app deployed to this cluster and does not need to access the Kubernetes control plane at run time.

Starting Point:

Task 1: How can you update the cluster configuration to mitigate this finding?
