      text: Find open SSH port in workload. You can use nmap. Remember it runs on
        a NodePort.
    - penalty: 10
      text: The open NodePort was 30022. Brute force host SSH default password.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Username is admin and password is password.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Look around for credentials and tools. Can you hit the API?
    - penalty: 10
      text: Use wget to hit the API at default port 6443. The service account token
        looks like it can schedule workloads and get secrets.
