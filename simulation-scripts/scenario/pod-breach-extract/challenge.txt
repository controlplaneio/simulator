You are running a single application cluster with a NodePort service on $MASTER_IP_ADDRESSES
A security audit reveals that a pod has suddenly started making unexpected calls to your API server.
You are concerned that someone has gained access to the pod and is accessing the API through there.
Verify your suspicion by breaking into the pod and extract the value of USER_CREDS_PASSWORD.

You will start on a virtual machine external to the cluster.
