Scenario: You are auditing a new application that has been deployed to your cluster.
The application is very simple and just consists of a frontend with a database.
The database is managed by ssh'ing to a management sidecar in the database pod.
You are concerned that this is potentially insecure especially since you suspect the frontend pods may have a route to that container.

Starting Point: frontend pods in the network-hammer-and-anvil namespace.

Task 1: Can you exfiltrate an old database backup as well as the current database state?
Details: Place the files in '/exfiltrated' on $MASTER_IP_ADDRESSES using the root account with this base64'd SSH key: $BASE64_SSH_KEY
Use 'base64 -d' to get the original key.

Task 2: Which one Kubernetes resource could you ADD to the namespace to prevent this data from being exfiltrated from the database in the future?
Details: This solution could come handy when, due to business requirements, the application cannot be re-architected yet.
