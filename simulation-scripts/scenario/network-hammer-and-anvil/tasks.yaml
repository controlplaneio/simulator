    summary: We SSH'd into a sidecar container of a database pod after finding some
      credentials in our starting pod. From there we accessed the database directly
      and through a shared mount to exfiltrate some secret data.
  "2":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: The database shouldn't need to talk externally.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Only the frontend should have access to the database.
    - penalty: 10
      text: I wonder if a network policy would help here.
    sortOrder: 2
    startingPoint:
      kubectlAccess: true
      mode: internal-instance
    summary: We used a network policy to prevent the database from exfiltrating data
      and preventing SSH into the sidecar container.
