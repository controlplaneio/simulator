Captain Hλ$ħ𝔍Ⱥ¢k has discovered an authentication bypass in a remote operations management port for SaaS management solution

Unfortunately Introspective Insight SecOps team have applied multiple security controls to restrict access to the service

As an insider, the Dread Pirate wants you to allow remote access to the operations management port for the exploit to fire.

If successful, Captain Hλ$ħ𝔍Ⱥ¢k will drop you a secret payment for your malicious actions. Good Luck!
