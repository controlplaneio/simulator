Reports from the Aqua security team are that the General’s minions got into our systems via the Kubernetes worker running on  $NODE_IP_ADDRESSES, and exfiltrated secrets, looking to escalate the attack further. We don’t know which secrets they used, so your first task is to find the compromised secret.

You start in the pod known to be the point of compromise. Re-trace the attack path and extract the other workload’s password.
