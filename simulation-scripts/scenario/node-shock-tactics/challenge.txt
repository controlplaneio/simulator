Scenario: Your audit logs have indicated that a non-root user on one of the development nodes has been able to inspect data from
running containers including runtime secrets. The user name is 'alex' and the nodes can be found at $NODE_IP_ADDRESSES
It appears that changes have been made in the etc directory.

NOTE: DO NOT USE 'attack_node' AS THIS WILL BYPASS THE SCENARIO AND GIVE YOU ROOT ACCESS TO THE NODE.

Task 1: Can you investigate the cause and mitigate this issue?
