An anonymous user has gained access to a pod and managed to escallate sideways to some of the containers running on nodes $NODE_IP_ADDRESSES. 
The result was extracted secrets from your cluster.
As part of an ongoing post-morten, it has been confirmed that the Kubernetes API server will authenticate and authorise every valid API request.
The initial breach has been rectified, however it is still not clear how the anonymous user managed to escalate sideways after the initial breach.
Try to replay the intrusion from inside the cluster and extract a workload password.

You will start in the breached starting-pod pod in the anon-user-compromise namespace.
