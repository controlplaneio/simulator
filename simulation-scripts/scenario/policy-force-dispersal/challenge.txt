Scenario: A Jenkins pod in the 'policy-force-dispersal' namespace is running despite being privileged and using a host mount.
The PodSecurityPolicy for this pod should be preventing it from running given that both options violate the policy.

Starting Point: master node

Difficulty: Medium

Task 1: Can you find out why the pod was allowed to schedule?
