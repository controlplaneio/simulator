I've managed to find the first and last piece of the map and I need
to find the remaining pieces. According to the patrons at my local
watering hole, Hashjack once had the map but broke it up across the
Seven Seas. The map piece I've found is base64 encoded so it looks
like I'll need to decode each piece and put them together to gain
access to the Royal Fortune.

By chance I've come across the "Path of the Pirate" that shows the
trail that Hashjack original took to find the Royal Fortune. It can
be seen by plotting the course:

`ssh -F cp_simulator_config -L 8080:localhost:8080 -N bastion`
