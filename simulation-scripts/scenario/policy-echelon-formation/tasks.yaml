          I wonder if I can see the host processes in this container since it is
          a process monitor?
      - text: 'Hmm, if I can see the proccesses I wonder what /proc looks like?'
      - text: >-
          I'm looking for a postgres process so I should find its pid and check
          /proc for that pid.
      - text: Let's see if /proc/<pid>/environ has one of the values we need.
      - text: What's in /proc/<pid>/root?
      - text: The final secrets I need are in /proc/<pid>/root/secrets.

          kube-system and policy-vertical-envelopment namespaces
      - text: I'll need to enable the PSP controller in the api-server.
      - text: My PSP for Jenkins should prevent adding ALL capabilities to pods.
