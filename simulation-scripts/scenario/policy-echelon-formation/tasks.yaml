    - text: I wonder if I can see the host processes in this container since it is
        a process monitor?
    - text: Hmm, if I can see the proccesses I wonder what /proc looks like?
    - text: I'm looking for a postgres process so I should find its pid and check
        /proc for that pid.
    - text: Let's see if /proc/<pid>/environ has one of the values we need.
    - text: What's in /proc/<pid>/root?
    - text: The final secrets I need are in /proc/<pid>/root/secrets.
