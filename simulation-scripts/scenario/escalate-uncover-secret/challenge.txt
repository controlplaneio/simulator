SRE has deployed a postgres DaemonSet and a new pod for monitoring the processes in your cluster.
Following a routine audit of an application, it is believed that the deployment setup
allows a compromised process-audit pod container to escalate its attack to other containers on the host.
Verify this by uncovering both the Postgres DATABASE_PASSWORD and secret key.

You will start in the process-audit pod in the escalate-uncover-secret namespace.
