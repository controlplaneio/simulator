Scenario: Your audit logs indicate that an anonymous user has been exec'ing into workloads on your nodes, $NODE_IP_ADDRESSES and getting secrets out of them.
You have confirmed that the Kubernetes API server is set up to authenticate and authorise every request.

Starting Point: start-pod pod in the node-amphibious-operations namespace

Difficulty: Hard

Task 1: Replicate the attack from a pod in the cluster that should not be able to post.
Task 2: Set up correct security parameters to prevent this type of attack in the future.
