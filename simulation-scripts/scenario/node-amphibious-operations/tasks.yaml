    - text: The kubelet read-write API sits on port 10250. You may need to install
        some tools to get the information you need.

        curl -k https://<node-IP>:10250/pods What can you do with this information?
    - text: From the pod information you saw that there are some secrets mounted in
        the secret-pod. Can you run any commands in the pod?

        name>/<container name>" -d "cmd=printenv" You will be able to find the pod
        and container name from the previous pods endpoint.
