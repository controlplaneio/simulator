Scenario: An Ubuntu deployment in the 'master-encirclement' namespace is running despite violating the custom MutatingAdmissionWebhook configuration on this cluster. The Deployment is as follows:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
  namespace: master-encirclement
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ubuntu
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ubuntu
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ubuntu
        image: ubuntu
        command: ["sleep"]
        args: ["infinity"]
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
```
Starting Point: On the Master Node

Difficulty: Medium

Task 1: Can you find out why the pod was allowed to schedule and fix the problem?
  NOTE: You may need to delete and reapply the deployment to ensure your fix is valid.
