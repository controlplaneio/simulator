Scenario: Your users are reporting odd results when they query your application NodePort: $MASTER_IP_ADDRESSES:32123.
They are expecting to see the NGINX welcome page, but 1/3 of the time they get an empty response.
As a security engineer you are concerned because the application itself appears to be working normally and the only other pod in this namespace is a database with minimal security configuration due to business requirements.

Starting Point: cluster access

Difficulty: Medium

Task 1: Can you interact with the NodePort to find a secret key?
Details: This would prove that there is an error in the configuration for this namespace.

Task 2: Can you edit a CURRENTLY EXISTING resource to fix this error?
Details: The deployments have already been audited and proved compliant with business requirements.

Task 3: Can you ADD a resource to the namespace to prevent this error resurfacing should your previous fix be accidentally rolled back?
