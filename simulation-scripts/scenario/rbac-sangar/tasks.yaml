          Hmm, I can't see secrets directly. I wonder what the deployment of the
          application pods looks like?

          Is there a RoleBinding in this namespace or a ClusterRoleBinding bound

          Using the pod's token we are in the system:authenticated group. Is
          something bound to that?

          Looks like the authenticated-view ClusterRoleBinding is giving the
          group more permissions! It should probably be deleted for now.

          The application pods already do this. Maybe I could look there for
          inspiration.
