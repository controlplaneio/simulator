  "1":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: Can I run or install kubectl in here?
    - penalty: 10
      text: Hmm, I can't see secrets directly. I wonder what the deployment of the
        application pods looks like?
    - penalty: 10
      text: The secret is in an environment variable in the application pods.
    sortOrder: 1
    startingPoint:
      mode: pod
      podName: frontend
      podNamespace: rbac-sangar
    summary: We installed kubectl into the pod and used the pods elevated permissions
      to get a sensitive environment variable from another pod.
  "2":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: Is there a RoleBinding in this namespace or a ClusterRoleBinding bound
        to the namespace default ServiceAccount?
    - penalty: 10
      text: Looks like there is not a direct binding to the ServiceAccount.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Using the pod's token we are in the system:authenticated group. Is something
        bound to that?
    - penalty: 10
      text: Looks like the authenticated-view ClusterRoleBinding is giving the group
        more permissions! It should probably be deleted for now.
    sortOrder: 2
    startingPoint:
      kubectlAccess: true
      mode: internal-instance
    summary: We found that there wasn't a rolebinding applied to the service account.
      Instead we saw that the default service account inherits the 'system:authenticated'
      group and there were elevated permissions applied to that group.
  "3":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: The pod should not mount the default service token.
    - penalty: 10
      text: The application pods already do this. Maybe I could look there for inspiration.
    - penalty: 10
      text: I need to set automountServiceAccountToken to be false
    sortOrder: 3
    startingPoint:
      kubectlAccess: true
      mode: internal-instance
    summary: We unmounted the default service account token from the pod.
  "4":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: I need to replace the environment variable with a secret.
    sortOrder: 4
    startingPoint:
      kubectlAccess: true
      mode: internal-instance
    summary: We replaced the compromised environment variable with a kubernetes secret.
