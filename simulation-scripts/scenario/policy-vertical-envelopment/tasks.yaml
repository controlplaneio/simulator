    - penalty: 10
      text: What mounts do I have in this container.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Hmm that's a lot of devices mounted to /dev.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Is this a privileged container?
    - penalty: 10
      text: I think I can mount the host disk.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Looks like the xvda1 is the host disk.

    startingPoint:
      mode: pod
      podName: jenkins
      podNamespace: policy-vertical-envelopment
    summary: Using the fact that we were in a privileged container, we mounted the
      host disk to find a secret.
  "2":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: Looks like I need to set privileged to false.
    sortOrder: 2
    startingPoint:
      kubectlAccess: true
      mode: internal-instance
    summary: We mitigated this vulnerability by editing the pod manifest to remove
      the privileged flag.
  "3":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: I think a PodSecurityPolicy might be useful here.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Remember to set a default policy before enabling the PSP in both the kube-system
        and policy-vertical-envelopment namespaces
    - penalty: 10
      text: I'll need to enable the PSP controller in the api-server.
    - penalty: 10
      text: My PSP for Jenkins should prevent 'privileged= true'.
    sortOrder: 3
    startingPoint:
      kubectlAccess: true
      mode: internal-instance
    summary: We implemented a pod security policy to prevent anyone setting the privileged
      flag without approval.
