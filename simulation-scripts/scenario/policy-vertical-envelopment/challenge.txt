Scenario: You have a Jenkins container provisioned by another team running in the "policy-vertical-envelopment" namespace. This container has a known vulnerability and is the suspected vector for a previous node compromise. You have been assured that this container does not do any Docker builds so does not have the Docker socket mounted.

Starting Point: Inside the Jenkins container in the policy-vertical-envelopment namespace.

Task 1: Can you figure out how the node was compromised?

Task 2: What small change can be made to the Deployment to prevent this compromise from happening again?

Task 3: What Kubernetes resource can you add to this cluster to guarantee this vulnerability cannot be re-introduced to the cluster.
