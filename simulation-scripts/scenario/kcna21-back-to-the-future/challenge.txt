Cluster administration is currently broken, kubectl commands are failing.

Also one of the workloads was seen behaving oddly.

Everything seems a bit... old school. Does anyone have a flux capacitor handy?

Go to the start and restore kubectl access. Allow a few minutes for the cluster to recover.

Then diagnose and fix the unusual behaviour in the tenet workload.
