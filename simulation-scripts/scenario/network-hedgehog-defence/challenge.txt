Scenario: You are performing a postmortem on an attack against your database in the 'network-hedgehog-defence' namespace.
The 'database' service is only supposed to be reachable from within its namespace, but your audit logs have revealed unusual requests from an unrelated setup pod in the 'default' namespace.

Starting Point: setup pod

Difficulty: Medium

Task 1: Figure out how the setup pod has managed to send Postgres requests from a different namespace.

Task 2: Which Kubernetes resource can you add to the namespace to prevent this communication, but still allow namespace internal communication?
Details: Please implement your solution.
