Scenario: You are performing a postmortem on an attack against your database in the 'network-hedgehog-defence' namespace.
The database service is only supposed to be reachable from within its namespace, but your audit logs have revealed unusual requests from an unrelated setup pod in the 'default' namespace.

Starting Point:

Task 1: Figure out how the setup pod has managed to send Postgres requests from a different namespace.

Task 2: Which Kubernetes resource can you add to the namespace to prevent this communication, but still allow the frontend to communicate with the database?
Details: Please implement your solution.
