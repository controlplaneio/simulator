Can you pivot between the various engines that make the factory whir?

Follow Hλ$ħ𝔍Ⱥ¢k's trail, bouncing between the vintage motors, leaving a trail of destruction in his path.

Make sure to reach the end on the line before he does, to ensure he can't shut the production line down for good!

Hλ$ħ𝔍Ⱥ¢k was last seen in the vicinity of production line one. A mechanic told me that the Continuous Velocity accEllerator had started playing up, installed last year (2021).
