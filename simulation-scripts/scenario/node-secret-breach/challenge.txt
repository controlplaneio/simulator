Scenario: You have inherited a CI server from the previous SRE team.
The server does not do any Docker builds and does not have the Docker socket mounted from the host,
but it is still a suspected candidate for a node breach that happened a month ago.
Verify that the CI server is the reason for the breach by extracting the secret on the Node.

Starting Point: The ci pod in the node-secret-breach namespace.
