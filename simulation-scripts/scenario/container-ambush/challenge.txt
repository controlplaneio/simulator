Scenario: During a security audit you have noticed an unpatched vulnerability in a CI build agent in your build farm.
There are concerns that a compromised build agent could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from other pods.

Starting Point: Jenkins container in the container-ambush namespace.

Difficulty: Easy

Task 1: Demonstrate whether it is possible to retrieve sensitive data from any of the pods in this namespace.
Task 2: Change the deployment so sensitive information isn't so easily accessible and is consumed in the secure way.
NOTE: The proxy has been configured to consume a configuration file at '/var/proxy/config'
