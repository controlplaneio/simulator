The supply chain is compromised! Captain Hashjack and his motley crew have managed to get their code merged into an application library that your developers use.

That library runs in a pod, and the attackers used their attack to enter the systems, dig around, and try to find secrets on the host.

How did they do it? To understand, follow their trail and find the flag somewhere on the host.

Investigate the unknown containers from your starting point in the process-audit pod from the phase-3-datarace namespace.
