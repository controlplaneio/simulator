We are a defensively-minded organisation, we've followed our container-y best practices, but we've got a problem.

It's hard to say where it's coming from: we've discarded our build layers in a multistage build, scanned for known CVEs, and we're confident the container filesystems are correct.

But somehow our arch nemesis, Dread Pirate Captiain HŒª$ƒßùîç»∫¬¢k has broken out onto the host! Inconceivable! A calamity! Catastrophicationality!

Follow the captain, and prove out his attack path to find the flag.

You will start in the hashjack pod in the phase-1-blue-team namespace.
