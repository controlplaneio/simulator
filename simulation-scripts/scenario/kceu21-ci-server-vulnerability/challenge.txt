The databases are secured, but the Captain’s trail of destruction still blazes a path through Container Ventures Extraordinaire’s systems. The infestation has reached the CI servers. All builds were passing just moments ago but have just lit up red — all Container Ventures Extraordinaire’s git repositories have been cryptolocked! The CI server should have only used read-only credentials, but it’s too late for that now, those git repos need decrypting.

You will start in the build-tools pod in the phase-4-lockout namespace. Find the flag so your colleagues can get back to work!
