Scenario: During a routine audit of your logs, it was noticed that the Jenkins user in the container within the 'policy-fire-support' namespace was accessing files it should not have permissions to read.
These files are host mounted SSH keys for managing other infrastructure.

Starting Point: jenkins pod in policy-fire-support namespace

Difficulty: Easy

Task 1: Can you replay this by getting the SSH Keys from the container?

Task 2: What small configuration change can you make to prevent the Jenkins user from reading these files?
Details: The deployment and RBAC of the container have been audited already and conform to internal standards.
