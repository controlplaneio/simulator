# Difficulty

Guidelines for categorising the difficulty of scenarios.

## Easy

* Mostly Kubernetes API based
* Usually shorter
* Many, prescriptive hints
* Solvable using kubernetes.io

## Intermediate

* May include Node or Master based tasks
* Likley to still be based on a common misconfiguration
* May require using a seach engine as well as kubernetes.io
* May require using a non-Kubernetes tool

## Hard

* Will contain larger tasks
* Hints will be less prescriptive
* May require a siginificant time investment
* Most likley will require using a search engine
