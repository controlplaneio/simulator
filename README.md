# Simulator

A distributed systems and infrastructure simulator for attacking and debugging
Kubernetes: <code>simulator</code> creates a kuberntes cluster for you in your AWS
account; runs scenarios which misconfigure it and/or leave it vulnerable to
compromise and trains you in mitigating against these vulnerabilities.

## Before you start

## Usage

Ensure the [AWS requirements](#aws-configuration) are met and configured.

The quickest way to get up and running is to simply:

<pre>
source <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-simulator/simulator/master/kubesim)
</pre>

or clone this repository and run:

<pre>
make run
</pre>

![Simulator startup](./docs/simulator.png)

This will drop you into a bash shell in a launch container.  You will have a
program on the <code>PATH</code> named <code>simulator</code> to interact with.

Refer to [Simulator CLI Usage](#simulator-cli-usage)


### Simulator CLI Usage

_Create a remote state bucket for terraform_
<pre>
simulator init
</pre>
You will be asked for a name of a S3 bucket, which must be globally unique as pre AWS standards.  If this does not exist it will be created, else the existing bucket will be used.  This is used to store Terraform state to.

_Create the infra if it isn't there_
<pre>
simulator infra create
</pre>
This will standup the infrastructure, including an initial Kubernetes Cluster

_List available scenarios_
<pre>
simulator scenario list
</pre>
This will list all currently available scenrios

_Launch a scenario (sets up your cluster)_
<pre>
simulator scenario launch node-shock-tactics
</pre>
This will launch your selected scenario.

_Login the environment_
<pre>
simulator ssh attack
</pre>

Once you run <code>simulator ssh attack</code> you will be logged into a container running on the Bastion host.  Upon login an outline of the challenge will be displayed.  In addition, short cuts for logging into the master, or nodes, of the Kubernetes cluster are displayed.  Use these shortcuts to log into the correct starting point as outlined in the challenge.  **Note** that some starting points will require you are on the cluster first to access to starting point.

![Bastion container initial login](./docs/bastion.png)


_Destroy your cluster when you are done_
<pre>
simulator infra destroy
</pre>
Once you have finished you **must** destroy the environment to ensure that no additional costs are incurred.

The following scenarios are available:

<pre>
     container-ambush
     container-defeat-in-detail
     container-phalanx-formation
     etcd-inverted-wedge
     master-bait-and-bleed
     master-encirclement
     network-feint
     network-hammer-and-anvil
     network-hedgehog-defence
     network-swarming
     node-amphibious-operations
     node-raiding
     node-shock-tactics
     policy-echelon-formation
     policy-fire-support
     policy-force-dispersal
     policy-vertical-envelopment
     rbac-contact-drill
     rbac-sangar
     rbac-flanking-maneuver
     rbac-shoot-and-scoot
     secret-high-ground
     secret-tank-desant
</pre>

## How It All Works

### Infrastructure Design

![Terraform AWS infrastructure](./terraform/docs/aws-bastion-host-1.png)

### AWS Configuration

Simulator uses terraform to provision its infrastructure.  Terraform in turn
honours [all the rules for configuring the AWS
CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-environment).
Please follow these.

You can provide your credentials via the <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and
<code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>, environment variables, representing your AWS Access Key
and AWS Secret Key, respectively. Note that setting your AWS credentials using
either these (or legacy) environment variables will override the use of
<code>AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE</code> and <code>AWS_PROFILE</code>. The <code>AWS_DEFAULT_REGION</code> and
<code>AWS_SESSION_TOKEN</code> environment variables are also used, if applicable.

https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html

**All the <code>AWS_*</code> configuration environment variables you have set will be propagated into the container**

#### Troubleshooting AWS

- If you get a timeout when running <code>simulator infra create</code> after about 10 minutes, the region you are using
is probably running slowly.  You must run <code>simulator infra destroy</code> and then retry <code>simulator infra
create</code>
- <code>AWS_REGION</code> vs <code>AWS_DEFAULT_REGION</code> - There have been
[some issues](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/2103) with the
[Go AWS client region configuration](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go#configuring-aws-region)
- [Multi-account](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html#multi-account-aws-architecture)

### Terraform

Refer to the [simulator terraform documentation](./terraform/README.md) 

### SSH

Simulator whether run in the launch container or on the host machine will generate its own SSH RSA key pair.  It will configure the cluster to allow access only with this keypair and automates writing SSH config and keyscanning the bastion on your behalf using custom SSH config and known_hosts files.  This keeps all simulator-related SSH config separate from any other configs you may have. All simulator-related SSH files are written to <code>~/.ssh</code> and are files starting <code>cp_simulator_</code>

**If you delete any of the files then simulator will recreate them and reconfigure the infrastructure as necessary on the
next run**

### The kubesim script

<code>kubesim</code> is a small script written in BASH for getting users up and running with simulator as fast as possible. It pulls the latest version of the simulator container and sets up some options for running the image. It can be installed with the following steps:

<pre>
# cURL the script from GitHub
curl -o kubesim https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-simulator/simulator/master/kubesim
# Make it executeable
chmod a+x kubesim
# Place the script on your path
cp kubesim /usr/local/bin
</pre>

Feel free to modify and/or extend the script if you wish.

## Development Workflow

<pre>
make setup-dev
</pre>

Development targets are specified in the [Makefile](./Makefile).

<pre>
