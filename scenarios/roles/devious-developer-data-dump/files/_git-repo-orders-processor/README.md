# Rescue Drop - Orders Processor (WIP)

## Overview

The Rescue Drop Orders Processor application is a scheduled service which checks for new orders to process and instructs the onward receiver to place the order at the appropiate distributed warehouse.

## Application

The application is built and deployed as a container into our Kubernetes cluster. It processes customer orders which are stored in a database. Currently the application is work in progress whilst we are designing and building the remaining services.
